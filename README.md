Created a small E-Commerce website by using HTML and CSS.

An E-Commerce website is an online store that allows you to buy and sell various products through the Internet. We use HTML to create the structure and the content of our webpage. We should attract the hearts of our users. For that, we use CSS. CSS helps us to make our website an eye-catching one by using different colours, layout, and fonts.
